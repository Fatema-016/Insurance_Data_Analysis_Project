# Insurance Data Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of insurance claim records using Power BI. The goal is to provide key insights into claim trends, Sentiment Analysis and Policy Claim Information.

## Project Overview

The Power BI report visualizes key metrics such as:
* **Total Claims:** An overview of the number of claims filed.
* **Claim Amount Distribution:** Analysis of claim values by policy type.
* **Sentiment Analysis:** An analysis of customer feedback and notes to determine overall sentiment (Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement).
* **Policy Type Claims by Age Group:** A detailed breakdown of claims based on the age of the policyholder and their policy type.


## Data Source

The analysis is based on a simulated insurance dataset containing details on policyholders and their claims.
* **Source File:** `Data/Insurance_Data.xlsx`
* **Data Import:** The data was imported into Power BI using the SQL query file provided.

## Tools and Technologies

* **Power BI Desktop:** Used for data modeling, transformation, and visualization.
* **SQL:** A custom SQL query was used to import the data into Power BI, demonstrating data preparation skills.
* **Excel:** The raw data is stored in an Excel spreadsheet.
